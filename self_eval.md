# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
**This section required more back referencing in order to review the concept that applied to the ask. Hashes 2 added enough complexity that I needed to return to old material several times. Once reviewed, I was able to execute with realtive ease, but its clear some of these concepts will require using repeatedly before they become ingrained knowledge to call from**
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
**I have not taken many hand writting notes. I have bookmarked the previous lessions and use them regularly as references and that seems to be super effective**
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
**I generally will put my head to it and try to recall the key concept before moving to referencing notes/assignments. I really like to double back to previous code I have written before I go to google. I have found it very helpful to dive into old git repositories and seeing how I executed in the past. Once I know that the information doesnt exist in something Ive done before, then I will google.**
